                                BLOCKCHAIN NOTES
What exactly is bockchain?
    It is a distributed ledger of transactions that is constantly updated and reviewed. It enables peer to peer tranfer of assets without any intermediaries. It provides single source of truth. it is also known as DLT-distributed ledger technology.  It is IMMUTABLE. 

    It was first created for bitcoin but now it is present in many fields like, goods transfer, remote service, identity management etc.

    Key Features of Blockchain:
    Decentralization= No central authority
-   Immutability= Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered.
-   Transparency=  Anyone can view the ledger (in public blockchains).
-   Security= Uses cryptographic algorithms to protect data.

    Advantages= greter trust
                enhanced security
                better traceability
                increased effeciency
                automated transactions

   TYPES=   cryptocurrency only-----bitcoin etc
            currency + business logic-----ethereum etc
            business logic----linux hyperledger

    CLAASSIFICATION= Public
                     Private
                     consortium (permissioned)
                     (we can understand them by their names tho)

    OPERATIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN=
                    Validation of transactions
                    gathering transactions for a BLOCK
                    broadcasting valid transactions and block 
                    concensus on next block creation
                    chaining all blocks to create immutable chain/record

    GENESIS BLOCK= first block in blockchain.
    MINERS= powerful computers executing sotware programs defined by blockchain protoccol.
 
    SMART CONTRACT=  a piece of self executing code deployed in a blockchain node. 
                    resembles a class diagram in object oriented design. it has,
                    data
                    functions
                    modifiers
                    along with get or set functions
    ACCOUNTS= two TYPES
             EOA (externally owned accounts) controlled by private key.
             CONTRACT ACCOUNT -controlled by code and can be activated by EOA.

    OMMERS= miners that solved puzzle but didnt win are called ommers. they create blocks called ommer blocks and are added as side blocks to the main block.

    ELIPTIC CURVE CRYPTO-ECC= this algorithm is used by ethereum for generating key pairs.
    it is better and stronger than RSA algorithm.

    HASHING= transforms and maps an arbitrary length of input data value to fixed lenngth value. It is a unique fingerprint of data. 
    requirements= 
                - algorithm should be one sided(can you make potatoes from mashed potatoes?)
                -collision free (no two data sets map onto same hash value)
    commom hashing algortihms= SHA-3, SHA-256 and KECCAK
    TYPES= two
         - simple hashing--when we have fixed number of data
         - markle tree hashing--used when no. of items differ from block to block.

    IN ETHEREUM, hash is used to generate
               -accounts addresses
               -digital signatures
               -transaction hash
               -state hash
               -receipt hash
               -block-header hash.
      
      CONCENSUS= 
                The consensus process in blockchain is the method by which all nodes in a decentralized network agree on a single version of the truth.
                Since thereâ€™s no central authority, consensus is essential to ensure that all copies of the distributed ledger are synchronized, accurate, and secure.
     Why Consensus Is Important=
                       -Ensures trust in a decentralized environment.

                       -Prevents double spending of cryptocurrencies.

                       -Protects the network from fraudulent activities and malicious actors.

                       -Keeps all participants (nodes) in agreement despite potentially conflicting information
    How the Consensus Process Works=
                    Transaction Proposal=
                    A user proposes a new transaction (e.g., sending cryptocurrency).

                    Broadcasting=
                    The transaction is broadcast to all nodes in the network.

                    Validation=
                    Nodes verify the transaction (e.g., checking balances, digital signatures).

                    Block Formation=
                    Valid transactions are grouped into a block by a node (e.g., a miner or validator).

                    Consensus Mechanism=
                    The network reaches agreement on which block to add next using a consensus algorithm.

                    Block Addition=
                    The chosen block is added to the blockchain, and all nodes update their copies.

    TRUST= In blockchain, trust refers to the confidence that participants have in the systems rules, processes, and outcomes, without needing to trust any individual party.
      
    TRUST TRAIL= 
               -valid TX
               -verify gas and resources
               -select set of TXs to create a block
               -execute TX to get a new state
               -form a new block
               -new block added to the chain
 
    establishing trust in BlockChain= 
               -secure chain using prrotocols 
               -validate transactions and blocks 
               -verify availability of resources
               -executing and confirming transactions 

    ROBUSTNESS=
            ability to satisfactorily manage exceptional situations.
            
    FORK= 
            In blockchain, a fork occurs when the blockchain diverges into two (or more) potential paths forward, usually due to:

            -A change in the protocol or rules
            -Temporary disagreement between nodes
    SOFT FORK=
            Bootstrapping the new software to already running process.
    
    HARD FORK=
            Major change in protocol.
            (new versions)
